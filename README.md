# BDFD-TextSplit-Variables

This guide will teach how you can store multiple variables inside a single variable, with the use of some functions. This way you can exceed the amount of maximum amount of variables by storing much information inside a variable.


In this guide we'll learn to setup some basic economy commands along with other useful commands a normal bot would have (levelling up, shop, balance, deposit and withdraw + bank limit).
I'm looking forward to see people actually understanding what this Guide is, so I will do my best to explain how everything based on "TextSplit" Variables works.
